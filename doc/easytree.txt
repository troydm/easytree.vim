 1. INTRODUCTION                                                  *easytree.vim-intro*

easytree.vim - is a simple tree file manager for vim.
While being highly inspired by NERDTree it differs from it in it's approach to a file
management and takes a more traditional vim yank/paste file copy/paste/delete approach
It's also more simpler in it's functionality and has much less features compared to other
file managers. It's goal is to be as fast and as minimalistic as possible.
Just the right tool for just the right task

Platform:
    only unix based operating systems are supported

:EasyTree [directory path]
    Opens a new window on the |g:easytree_win| side with specified directory in easytree buffer
    If directory is not specified uses the current working directory as root
    The first line of buffer contains a full path of an opened directory
    Second line contains .. symbol that is used to go up in filesystem hierarchy
    Directories are usually prepended with ▸ or ▾ meaning they are expanded or closed

        To edit file in new horizontal split window press |s| or |sp| instead
        To edit file in new tab window press |t| instead
        When file is directory it will open it in new |EasyTree| buffer instead
    Directory open/close:
        To expand/close directory and close directory file is in use |<Space>|
        To expand a directory move your cursor over the line with a specified directory
        and press |<Enter>| or |o|. Pressing |O| will expand all sub directories too

        line and press |C| to use it as root for easytree.
        Pressing |cd| will make that directory current working directory but won't change the root of easytree
        To jump to another directory press |J| and specify a full path to the directory you want to jump to
        To quickly go to your home directory just press |H|
        To refresh current expanded directory listing press |r| while having your line over that directory
        Pressing |R| will refresh whole easytree buffer

        Same way to delete file/dir just move your cursor over that file/dir press |dd|
        To delete multiple files/dirs just select them in visual mode and press |d|
        To move files/dirs copy them via yy/y. Then move your cursor over the
        directory you want to put them in and press <m-p> (Alt + p).

        To get information about file/dir just move your cursor over that file/dir and press |i|
        If you press <C-g> over a file/dir it's path will be printed. The path is relative to

        will be printed.
        To toggle visibility of hidden files just press |I|
        To hide some files in current tree according to comma seperated pattern list use |zf|
        To hide some dirs in current tree according to comma seperated pattern list use |zd|

        To close easytree window just press |q|
    Git status:
        Git status when enabled via |g:easytree_git_enable| option shows
        information related to git status of each file via status indicators
        next to that file. Each file can have multiple status indicators.
        Each status indicator shows information related to status of that file:
           - branch name shown next to .. (up a dir) line
          ✗ - unstaged file
          ✔︎ - staged file
          | - difference between index/working tree, in case of merging it's us/them
          ✹ - file modified
          ✚ - file added
          ✖ - file deleted
          ➜ - file renamed
          ➜ - file copied
          ═ - unmerged file
